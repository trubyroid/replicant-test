Voight-Kampff test
==================

This is an implementation of [test](https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/Voight-Kampff_test) from **Blade Runner** universe.  
It writes a history of participants and defines replicants.   
There is ten questions which you may answer and four parameters, which you need to enter after each question.  
If you will don't answer or insert the parameters, random variant will be chosen.

Clone repo and enter "python3 main.py" to go through the test.

In this project I studyed PyTest and Sphinx.  
You will find tests in /tests and documentation in /docs/build/html/index.html
