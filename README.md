# replicant-test
Here I studying PyTest and Sphinx.

This is an implementation of Voight-Kampff test from "Blade Runner" universe.
There is ten questions which you may answer and four parameters, which you need to enter after each question.
If you will don't answer or insert the parameters, random variant will be chosen.

Clone repo and enter "python3 main.py" to go through the test.
